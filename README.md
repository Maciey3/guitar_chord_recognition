# Guitar Chord Recognition
This project was made on Computer Vision - University course. Our task was to come up with a problem, and then solve it.
My case is based on machine learning. I wanted to make a model which will recognise guitar chord based on finger positioning. To make that i used Mediapipe tools to detect fingers and to learn model on these finger positioning.
My approach is working like this:

The "C" on the bottom, is guitar chord recognition model output (in this case, C is the now played chord). Also I made a finger positioning label, in the future i will make custom Neural Network, which will recognise chord by x and y values of each finger point.
